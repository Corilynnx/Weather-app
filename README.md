🌤️ Weather App

A beginner-friendly weather application built with vanilla JavaScript, focused on API integration, DOM manipulation, and clean UI state management. Users can search for a city to view current weather conditions and a short-term forecast.

This project was created as part of my front-end learning journey and demonstrates my ability to work with real-world APIs and dynamic UI updates without frameworks.

What This App Does

Allows users to search for weather by city name

Fetches real-time data from the OpenWeatherMap API

Displays:

Current temperature (°F)

Weather conditions

Humidity

Wind speed

Shows a 5-day forecast (one entry per day)

Handles invalid city searches gracefully

Updates the UI dynamically based on app state
